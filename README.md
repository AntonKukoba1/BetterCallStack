# BetterCallStack

## IDA 7.7 plugin to improve the call stack for Windows x64 debugger

Setup the include directory and libraries path in BetterCallStack project to point at appropriate IDA SDK directories. And then just build it. Put BetterCallStack64.dll into IDA plugins directory. That's it.

The plugin will automatically run when debugger is on.
